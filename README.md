For my 10th grade robotics class I created a arduino radar turret. The radar rotates until it detects something, then the turret turns toward it and fires. 
Radar.ino contains the arduino code and Radar.pde just creates a nice looking visualization. I'm pretty proud of some of this, but I'd be lying if i said this wasnt something of a rush job.
I was slightly limited by my materials, and if I had gotten my handas on a better radar bit, I think this project could've came out a lot nicer.
